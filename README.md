This is a super rough sketch of a game at the moment. You play as a pinhead person who punches the air, and sometimes knocks down boxes. Press F while you're moving to go all limp, E to pick up boxes. Maybe even try to click on the boxes sometime. More will be coming!  

To try this game out, download the RAR archive to extract the executable file. Should be titled "FirstGame"
